#Memory Game#

*Remember preschool and matching all the little animals to see who could be the most pairs?  Yes, this is exactly like that, only different!*

#**How to Play**#

click on a card to flip it over.
Clicking 2 cards equals 1 move. The timer starts on the click of the first card.
When all cards have been matched, you win! A popup will reveal your score (1-3 stars), your time and the number of moves.

****stars are based on moves, not time.****
*You can play the game by cloning the file and opening in a seperate window: OR you can play a demo of this game at the following website:
